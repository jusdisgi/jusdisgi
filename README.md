- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jusdisgi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cloud services (mainly working in Google Cloud Platform), split ergomech keyboards, 3d printing, CNC, sewing, hiking/camping, fast cars, and unicycles. And just about anything else worth getting nerdy about.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to design PCBs, for keyboards mainly, using ergogen and KiCad.
