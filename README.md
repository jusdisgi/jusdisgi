- 👋 Hi, I’m Hunter Cook.
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud services (mainly working in Google Cloud Platform), split ergomech keyboards, 3d printing, CNC, sewing, hiking/camping, fast cars, and unicycles. And just about anything else worth getting nerdy about.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to design PCBs, for keyboards mainly, using ergogen and KiCad.
